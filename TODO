Wishlist for the Folder indexer plugin
======================================

  "For very large databases maybe there could be an option for a
  starting point and a timed interval (something like "sync starting
  from today, last three days of studies"), so orthanc could be used
  as an option a simple contingency of a main server."

* From Sylvain:
  If MaximumStorageSize is defined in Orthanc, the indexer plugin 
  stops indexing once this limit is reached.  MaximumStorageSize should
  be used only for Orthanc own storage, not for indexed studies.
